						<p>
							Radio Frequency Micro Mechanical System (RF MEMS) switches are swiches that allow/block RF current/wave. They are actuated by electrostatic force between a ground plane and a suspended bridge, all are made of metals. When the bridge is up, the current is allowed to transmit through the transmission line (Fig. 1, left), whereas when the bridge is down, the current is directed to the ground (Fig. 1, right). In capacitive switches, there is a dielectric layer to prevent the ground plane and the bridge from direct contact (green layer in Fig. 1). My thesis focuses on this dielectric layer.

							Usually, a high dielectric constant is preferable since it ensures a high off-state isolation - high performance. However, if the dielectric material is not strong enough to withstand the high biased voltage, it will break down and becomes useless. In my thesis, I studied metal oxides to find such a material that can satisfy the two above conditions. After inspection on a wide range of metal oxides, I paid my attention on copper oxide. I have thermally grown and measured its dielectric strength in the cleanroom. Experiments have revealed that thermally grown CuO film has a low dielectric strength (0.2 MV/cm). Also, when annealing CuO, dendrite structures emerge above the oxide surface (Fig. 2). This could explain the low dielectric strength of the film. In conlusion, CuO is not an ideal material for RF MEMS switches.

						</figure>
						
						<p>						
							In parallel with experimental work, I have also carried out the analyses and simulations of CuO switches. My goal is to study the effects of switch dimensions, material properties, and process-induced issues (residual stress, etching holes) on the performance of the switches. Simulations of RF MEMS switches have been performed in a multiphysics environment (COMSOL), with coupled electrostatic, mechanical, and electromagnetic studies. An aproximate analytical model was proposed to compare with the simulations. In this model, I considered a general case where the bridge width is comparable to its length, and thus, bending of plate should be studied. The exact solution for deflection of a rectangular clamped-clamped plate with central loading is difficult to obtained due to boundary conditions of the two free sides. My thesis proposes an approximate solution. The principle of minimum potential energy was employed to find a polynomial of coordinate variables that could approximate the deflection surface of the bridge (Fig. 3). In conclusion, it was found that bending, stretching and especially, residual stress have strong effects on mechanical behavior of the switches, particularly the pull-in voltage. The simulation and the analytical model could be helpful for designing and optimizing RF MEMS switches .
